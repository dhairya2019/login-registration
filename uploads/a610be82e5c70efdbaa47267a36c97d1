The basic rule of doing business backup is if losing that data will interfere with your business back it up.

Local Data Backup Service

We are using Local Area Network to store data in our off-site servers. We have setup a server and we transfer our data from computers
to server using LAN storage. We are also implemeting RAID mirroring techniques to replicate the data in two or more disks.
The controller can be software or a hardware add-in card.The customers details and business related data are stored locally

Remote Cloud Disaster Recovery Site

Dashboard
There are hundreds of moving parts in your business that impact your overall performance.

A business dashboard summarizes these events with easy-to-understand, real-time data visuals. For cars, you can immediately see how fast you are traveling, how much fuel you have in your tank and more. It even provides a “Check Engine” symbol as a warning when there’s something wrong with the engine.

Dashboard provides real time results by extracting value from all the data you collect

Operational Dashboards – This is the most common dashboard type, with metrics updating in real-time showing data related to daily operations.

Analytical Dashboards – Use data from the past to identify trends that can influence future decision-making.
 
Strategic Dashboards – Track performance in relation to your key performance.
